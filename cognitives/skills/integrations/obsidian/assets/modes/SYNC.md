# SYNC Mode - Write to Obsidian Vault

## When to Use This Mode

- User explicitly asks to **sync**, **save**, **move**, or **store** files to Obsidian
- (ES) User says "guardar en obsidian", "sincronizar a obsidian", or similar in Spanish
- User asks to **create a report/plan AND save it to Obsidian** (this mode handles the Obsidian part after creation)
- User wants to **browse their vault** to choose where to place documents
- User asks to move an entire folder (e.g., `{output_base}/planning/`) to their Obsidian vault
- After another skill finishes generating documents, user wants them in Obsidian

## When NOT to Use This Mode

- User wants to read or search notes already in Obsidian (use READ mode)
- User wants to edit an existing Obsidian note in-place (use MCP tools directly)
- Files are not markdown or text-based (this mode is for `.md` content)

---

## Critical Rules

**RULE 0 - USE THE EXACT PATH THE USER GIVES YOU**

When the user specifies a vault destination path, use it **exactly as given**. Do not modify it, do not substitute it, do not "improve" it. The `~/.agents/` pattern found in skill examples is an `output_base` convention for other skills — it is NOT a vault folder and must NEVER be used as a vault destination. If the user says "save to `work/my-project/plans/`", write to `work/my-project/plans/` — never to `agents/`, `agents/{project-name}/`, or any variation.

**RULE 1 - ALWAYS ASK WHERE TO SAVE**

Never assume the destination folder. Always:
1. List the vault's root directories
2. Let the user pick or specify the destination
3. If the user already specified a path, use it directly — confirm it exists or offer to create it
4. NEVER default to `agents/` or any variation as a vault folder

**RULE 2 - PRESERVE CONTENT INTEGRITY**

- Read the source file completely before writing to Obsidian
- Never modify the document body content (headings, paragraphs, tables, code blocks, `## Referencias` section)
- Only ADD or MERGE frontmatter metadata — never edit anything below the closing `---`
- If the file already has frontmatter, merge Obsidian-specific fields without overwriting existing ones
- Cross-reference fixes (via cross-ref-validator) update the `related` frontmatter array only

**RULE 3 - GENERATE MEANINGFUL FRONTMATTER**

Every note written to Obsidian MUST include frontmatter following the universal schema:

```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"
project: "{project-name}"
type: "{document-type}"
status: "active"
version: "1.0"
tags: [relevant, tags, here]
changelog:
  - version: "1.0"
    date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
    changes: ["Synced to Obsidian"]
related:
  - "[[related-document]]"
---
```

Infer these values from:
- `title`: First H1 heading in the document, or filename
- `date`: File modification date, or today's date
- `updated`: Today's date (sync date)
- `project`: Current working directory name or git repo name
- `type`: Infer from content using the 14-type taxonomy (see expanded type inference table below)
- `status`: `"active"` for new documents, preserve existing status
- `version`: `"1.0"` for new documents, preserve existing version
- `tags`: Infer from project name, document type, and key topics
- `changelog`: Add sync entry
- `related`: Extract from `[[wiki-links]]` found in document content, or from `## Referencias` section

**RULE 4 - REPORT RESULTS**

After syncing, always report:
- How many files were synced
- The exact Obsidian paths where they were saved
- Any files that were skipped and why

---

## Obsidian Output Standard

When syncing documents to Obsidian, follow the [Obsidian markdown standard](../standards/obsidian-md-standard.md) Sync rules:

1. **Frontmatter enrichment**: If a document has minimal frontmatter (only title/date/project/type/tags), enrich it with the full universal schema (add updated, status, version, changelog, related)
2. **Frontmatter preservation**: If a document already has rich frontmatter, preserve all existing fields — only add missing ones
3. **Frontmatter generation**: If a document has no frontmatter, generate the complete universal schema (see [../helpers/frontmatter-generator.md](../helpers/frontmatter-generator.md))
4. **Wiki-link preservation**: Never convert `[[wiki-links]]` to `[markdown](links)` — preserve them exactly
5. **Type inference**: Map document content to the 14-type taxonomy defined in the [Obsidian markdown standard](../standards/obsidian-md-standard.md)
6. **Cross-reference validation**: After syncing a batch of files, verify that `related` fields and `## Referencias` sections are bidirectional (see [../helpers/cross-ref-validator.md](../helpers/cross-ref-validator.md))
7. **Status**: New documents get `status: "active"`, documents with existing status are preserved

---

## Workflow

### Step 0: Detect Access Mode

Before any vault operation, determine the access strategy:

```
# Attempt MCP connection
ToolSearch query: "+obsidian write"
ToolSearch query: "+obsidian list"
```

| Result | Mode | Behavior |
|--------|------|----------|
| Tools loaded successfully | **MCP Mode** | Use `mcp__obsidian__*` tools for all operations |
| ToolSearch returns no obsidian tools | **Fallback Mode** | Ask user for vault path, use Write/Read/Edit/Glob/Bash |
| Tools load but fail on call | **Fallback Mode** | Warn user MCP may be disconnected, switch to filesystem |

**If entering Fallback Mode**, inform the user:

```
The Obsidian MCP server doesn't appear to be connected. I can still write to your vault
directly on the filesystem. What is the path to your Obsidian vault?
(e.g., ~/Documents/MyVault or ~/obsidian-vault)
```

Or use `AskUserQuestion`:
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What is the path to your Obsidian vault?"
  header: "Vault path"
  options:
    - label: "~/obsidian-vault"
      description: "Common default (macOS/Linux)"
    - label: "~/Documents/Obsidian"
      description: "Documents folder (macOS/Linux)"
    - label: "C:\\Users\\{username}\\Documents\\Obsidian"
      description: "Documents folder (Windows)"
```

### Step 1: Identify What to Sync

Use `Glob` to discover source files based on user request (specific file, directory, pattern, or recent output).

### Step 2: Load Obsidian MCP Tools (MCP Mode Only)

**MCP Mode:** Load required tools: `ToolSearch query: "+obsidian list"` and `ToolSearch query: "+obsidian write"`

**Fallback Mode:** Skip this step — vault path was already obtained in Step 0.

### Step 3: Browse Vault and Present Options

**MCP Mode:** List vault structure with `mcp__obsidian__list_directory`, build folder tree, present options via `AskUserQuestion`. If user specified destination, use it directly. Always include "Create new folder" option.

**Fallback Mode:**
```
Glob(pattern: "{vault_path}/*")
# Or for deeper browsing:
Bash(command: "find {vault_path} -maxdepth 2 -type d | head -30")
```
Build folder tree from results, present options via `AskUserQuestion`.

### Step 4: Read Source Files

Read all files in parallel using `Read` tool. Check for existing frontmatter, extract metadata.

### Step 5: Write to Obsidian

For each file, call `mcp__obsidian__write_note` with:

> **Important**: `content` is the raw markdown body **without** the `---` frontmatter block. `frontmatter` is a **separate JSON object** — the MCP server serializes it as YAML and prepends it to the content automatically. If the `path` includes directories that don't exist, they are created.

**Write modes:**

| Mode | Behavior | When to Use |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `"overwrite"` (default) | Replace entire note | New syncs, full document updates |
| `"append"` | Add content to end of note | Adding entries to a log, appending sections |
| `"prepend"` | Add content to beginning of note | Adding notices or headers to existing notes |

> Always use `"overwrite"` for standard sync operations. Use `"append"` only when explicitly adding to an existing note.

```
mcp__obsidian__write_note(
  path: "{vault-destination}/{filename}.md",
  content: "{markdown-body-without-frontmatter-block}",
  mode: "overwrite",
  frontmatter: {
    "title": "Document Title",
    "date": "2026-02-10",
    "updated": "2026-02-12",
    "project": "agent-sync-sdk",
    "type": "analysis",
    "status": "active",
    "version": "1.0",
    "source": "{output_base}/planning/2026-02-10/00-strategic-analysis.md",
    "tags": ["agent-sync-sdk", "analysis", "strategy"],
    "changelog": [{"version": "1.0", "date": "2026-02-12", "changes": ["Synced to Obsidian"]}],
    "related": ["[[01-technical-debt]]", "[[02-growth-vision]]"]
  }
)
```

**Fallback Mode:**

When writing without MCP, you must manually serialize frontmatter to YAML and prepend it to the content:

1. Generate the frontmatter object using the frontmatter-generator helper
2. Serialize it to YAML format
3. Construct the full file content: `---\n{yaml}\n---\n\n{body}`
4. Ensure the vault directory exists: `Bash(command: "mkdir -p {vault_path}/{destination}")`
5. Write the file: `Write(file_path: "{vault_path}/{destination}/{filename}.md", content: "{full_content}")`

**YAML Serialization Pattern:**

Given a frontmatter object:
```json
{
  "title": "Document Title",
  "date": "2026-02-10",
  "updated": "2026-02-14",
  "project": "my-project",
  "type": "analysis",
  "status": "active",
  "version": "1.0",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "changelog": [{"version": "1.0", "date": "2026-02-14", "changes": ["Synced to Obsidian"]}],
  "related": ["[[doc-a]]", "[[doc-b]]"]
}
```

Serialize as:
```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"
date: "2026-02-10"
updated: "2026-02-14"
project: "my-project"
type: "analysis"
status: "active"
version: "1.0"
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
changelog:
  - version: "1.0"
    date: "2026-02-14"
    changes:
      - "Synced to Obsidian"
related:
  - "[[doc-a]]"
  - "[[doc-b]]"
---
```

Then prepend to body content and use `Write` to save to `{vault_path}/{destination}/{filename}.md`.

**Frontmatter generation:**

See [../helpers/frontmatter-generator.md](../helpers/frontmatter-generator.md) for the complete frontmatter generation workflow.

**Type inference:**

Refer to the [Obsidian markdown standard](../standards/obsidian-md-standard.md) for the 14-type document taxonomy used in type inference.

**Wiki-link handling:**
- Preserve all existing `[[wiki-links]]` in document content exactly as-is
- Never convert `[[wiki-links]]` to `[markdown](relative-links)`
- If a document contains `## Referencias` section, preserve it and add to `related` frontmatter field

### Step 5a: Small Edits with patch_note (Optional)

When a sync involves only a small change to an existing note (e.g., updating a status, fixing a typo), use `patch_note` instead of rewriting the entire note:

```
mcp__obsidian__patch_note(
  path: "work/agent-sync-sdk/plans/PROGRESS.md",
  oldString: "status: IN_PROGRESS",
  newString: "status: COMPLETED",
  replaceAll: false
)
```

**When to use `patch_note` vs `write_note`:**
- **patch_note**: Changing 1-3 specific strings in an existing note. Faster, preserves the rest exactly.
- **write_note**: New notes, full re-syncs, or changes affecting >30% of the document.

> With `replaceAll: false` (default), `patch_note` fails if `oldString` matches more than once, preventing unintended replacements. Set `replaceAll: true` only when you want to replace every occurrence.

**Fallback Mode:**
```
Read(file_path: "{vault_path}/{file}")
# Find the exact string to replace
Edit(file_path: "{vault_path}/{file}", old_string: "status: IN_PROGRESS", new_string: "status: COMPLETED")
```

### Step 5.5: Cross-Reference Validation

After syncing a batch of files (2+ files), validate bidirectional references.

See [../helpers/cross-ref-validator.md](../helpers/cross-ref-validator.md) for the complete cross-reference validation workflow.

> **Optimization (v3.2)**: The cross-ref validator uses `mcp__obsidian__update_frontmatter` to fix missing reverse references instead of reading the full note and rewriting it. This is faster and safer since it only touches metadata.

**Example output:**
```
Cross-reference validation:
- SPRINT-1-foundation.md references [[PROGRESS]] ✓ (PROGRESS references back)
- ANALYSIS.md references [[CONVENTIONS]] ✓ (CONVENTIONS references back)
- PLANNING.md references [[ANALYSIS]] ⚠ Fixed: used update_frontmatter to add [[PLANNING]] to ANALYSIS related
```

### Step 6: Report Results

After all files are written, report a summary:

```
Synced to Obsidian:
- work/agent-sync-sdk/plans/00-strategic-analysis.md
- work/agent-sync-sdk/plans/01-technical-debt.md
- work/agent-sync-sdk/plans/02-growth-vision.md

3 files synced successfully to vault folder: work/agent-sync-sdk/plans/
```

---

## Batch Sync Pattern

When syncing an entire folder, process files efficiently to minimize latency and user interaction.

See [../helpers/batch-sync-pattern.md](../helpers/batch-sync-pattern.md) for the complete optimized batch sync workflow.

**Key principles:**
1. **Glob** all `.md` files once
2. **Read** all files in parallel
3. **Load** MCP tools once (MCP Mode) or use vault path (Fallback Mode)
4. **List** vault directory once
5. **Ask** user once for destination
6. **Write** all files sequentially
7. **Validate** cross-references after all writes
8. **Report** all results at the end

---

## Integration with Other Skills

This mode is the **output handler** for planning, analysis, and reporting skills. Composition pattern: producer skill generates documents locally → obsidian SYNC mode picks them up and syncs to vault. User says "create X and save to obsidian" — both steps happen automatically.

---

## Configuration Options

**Sync Scope**: Single file, directory, glob pattern, or output from another skill.
**Destination Logic**: Use user-specified path, suggest existing project folder, offer to create new folder, or list multiple projects for selection.

---

## Output Format Contract

Every SYNC operation MUST produce a response with these sections in this order:

```markdown
### Source Files
- {N} files detected in `{source_path}`
- [list each filename]

### Destination
- Vault folder: `{vault_destination}`
- [Created / Already existed]

### Write Results
| File | Status | Vault Path |
|------|--------|------------|
| {filename} | Synced | {vault_path} |
| {filename} | Skipped (already exists) | — |
| {filename} | Failed: {reason} | — |

### Cross-Reference Validation
- {N} bidirectional references verified
- {N} frontmatter fixes applied
- [list each fix if any]

### Warnings
- [any overwrites, missing sources, MCP issues — or "None"]
- Operating in filesystem fallback mode (no MCP) — if applicable
```

**Rules:**
- Always include all 5 sections, even if empty (use "None" or "N/A")
- Never omit Write Results — the user must know exactly what was written and where
- Failed writes must include the reason

---

## Best Practices

- **Before Sync**: Verify source files exist, access mode detected (MCP or fallback), producer skill completed
- **During Sync**: Never modify content (only frontmatter), process writes sequentially, warn before overwriting
- **After Sync**: Report all synced paths, any failures, and suggest visual verification in Obsidian

---

## Optional Workflow: Archive and Delete

When the user asks to clean up, archive, or remove vault notes.

> **DELETE is destructive and irreversible.** Always confirm with the user before deleting.

### Archive (Preferred)

1. **Move note to archive folder** using `move_note`:
   ```
   mcp__obsidian__move_note(
     oldPath: "work/agent-sync-sdk/plans/old-plan.md",
     newPath: "archive/agent-sync-sdk/old-plan.md",
     overwrite: false
   )
   ```
2. **Update frontmatter status** to `archived`:
   ```
   mcp__obsidian__update_frontmatter(
     path: "archive/agent-sync-sdk/old-plan.md",
     frontmatter: { "status": "archived", "updated": "2026-02-13" },
     merge: true
   )
   ```
3. **Report** the move with old and new paths.

### Delete (Destructive)

1. **Confirm with user** via `AskUserQuestion`:
   ```
   question: "Are you sure you want to permanently delete 'old-plan.md'? This cannot be undone."
   options:
     - "Yes, delete permanently"
     - "No, move to archive instead"
   ```
2. **If confirmed**, call `delete_note` with matching confirmation:
   ```
   mcp__obsidian__delete_note(
     path: "work/agent-sync-sdk/plans/old-plan.md",
     confirmPath: "work/agent-sync-sdk/plans/old-plan.md"
   )
   ```
3. **Report** the deletion and warn about broken references.

**Fallback Mode (Archive):**
```
Bash(command: "mkdir -p {vault_path}/archive/{project}")
Bash(command: "mv '{vault_path}/{old_path}' '{vault_path}/archive/{project}/{filename}'")
# Then update frontmatter manually:
Read(file_path: "{vault_path}/archive/{project}/{filename}")
# Parse frontmatter, change status to "archived", update "updated" field
Write(file_path: "{vault_path}/archive/{project}/{filename}", content: "{updated_content}")
```

**Fallback Mode (Delete):**
```
# Always confirm with user first via AskUserQuestion
Bash(command: "rm '{vault_path}/{file}'")
```

---

## Optional Workflow: Move and Reorganize

When the user asks to reorganize vault structure, move notes between folders, or rename notes.

### Single Note Move
```
mcp__obsidian__move_note(
  oldPath: "inbox/unsorted-note.md",
  newPath: "work/agent-sync-sdk/plans/sorted-note.md",
  overwrite: false
)
```

### Batch Reorganization

1. **List source directory**: `mcp__obsidian__list_directory(path: "inbox/")`
2. **Get metadata** for all notes: `mcp__obsidian__get_notes_info(paths: [...])`
3. **Ask user** for destination mapping
4. **Move notes sequentially**: `mcp__obsidian__move_note(...)` for each
5. **Update cross-references** if filenames changed:
   - Use `search_notes(query: "[[old-name]]")` to find referencing notes
   - Use `patch_note` to update wiki-links in other notes
6. **Report** all moves with old and new paths

> **Caution**: Moving a note breaks existing `[[wiki-links]]` if the filename changes. Obsidian handles this automatically if "Automatically update internal links" is enabled. If not, use `patch_note` to update references.

**Fallback Mode (Move):**
```
Bash(command: "mv '{vault_path}/{old_path}' '{vault_path}/{new_path}'")

# Update cross-references in other notes:
Grep(pattern: "\\[\\[old-name\\]\\]", path: "{vault_path}", type: "md")
# For each matching file:
Edit(file_path: "{matching_file}", old_string: "[[old-name]]", new_string: "[[new-name]]")
```

---

## Fallback Strategy (No MCP)

When the Obsidian MCP server is not available, SYNC mode operates in filesystem mode:

### Vault Discovery

Ask the user for the vault path if not known (same as READ mode fallback):
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What is the path to your Obsidian vault?"
  header: "Vault path"
  options:
    - label: "~/obsidian-vault"
      description: "Common default (macOS/Linux)"
    - label: "~/Documents/Obsidian"
      description: "Documents folder (macOS/Linux)"
    - label: "C:\\Users\\{username}\\Documents\\Obsidian"
      description: "Documents folder (Windows)"
```

### Writing Notes (Fallback)

```
# Ensure destination directory exists
Bash(command: "mkdir -p {vault_path}/{destination}")

# Construct full file content (frontmatter + body)
# See YAML Serialization Pattern in Step 5 above

# Write the file
Write(file_path: "{vault_path}/{destination}/{filename}.md", content: "{frontmatter_yaml}\n\n{body}")
```

### Browsing Vault (Fallback)

```
# List vault structure
Glob(pattern: "{vault_path}/**/*.md")

# Or browse directories
Bash(command: "find {vault_path} -maxdepth 2 -type d")
```

### Patching Notes (Fallback)

```
Read(file_path: "{vault_path}/{note_path}")
Edit(file_path: "{vault_path}/{note_path}", old_string: "...", new_string: "...")
```

### Moving/Archiving Notes (Fallback)

```
Bash(command: "mv '{vault_path}/{old}' '{vault_path}/{new}'")
```

### Deleting Notes (Fallback)

```
# Always confirm with AskUserQuestion first
Bash(command: "rm '{vault_path}/{file}'")
```

### Limitations in Fallback Mode

| Feature | MCP Mode | Fallback Mode |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| Write notes | Full support | Full support (manual YAML serialization) |
| Browse vault | Full support | Full support (via Glob/Bash) |
| Patch notes | Atomic string replace | Read + Edit (functionally equivalent) |
| Move/rename | Native API | Bash mv (functionally equivalent) |
| Delete | Double confirmation | Bash rm with AskUserQuestion confirmation |
| Frontmatter serialization | Automatic (MCP handles) | Manual (construct YAML string) |
| Auto-create directories | Automatic | Bash mkdir -p |
| Cross-ref validation | Native API | Read + parse + Write (slower on large vaults) |

---

## Limitations

- **MCP recommended**: The Obsidian MCP server provides optimized operations. When unavailable, filesystem fallback provides full functionality with manual YAML serialization.
- **Markdown only**: This mode handles `.md` files. Binary assets, images, and non-text files are not synced
- **No bidirectional sync**: This mode writes TO Obsidian, it does not pull changes back from Obsidian
- **No conflict resolution**: If a note exists at the destination, it will be overwritten (with user confirmation)
- **Single vault**: Operates on the vault connected to the MCP server; cannot switch between multiple vaults

---

## Example: Full Sync Flow

**User request:** "sync {output_base}/planning/ to obsidian"

1. **Glob**: Find all `.md` files in `{output_base}/planning/`
2. **Read**: Read all files in parallel
3. **Load**: `ToolSearch query: "+obsidian write"`
4. **List vault**: `mcp__obsidian__list_directory(path: "/")`
5. **Ask user**: "Where should I save these 3 documents?" → User picks `work/agent-sync-sdk/plans`
6. **Write**: Sequential writes to `work/agent-sync-sdk/plans/00-strategic-analysis.md`, etc.
7. **Validate**: Check cross-references, fix missing bidirectional links
8. **Report**: "Synced 3 files to Obsidian: work/agent-sync-sdk/plans/"
