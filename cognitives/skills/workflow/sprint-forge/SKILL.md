# Sprint Forge

## Assets

This skill uses a modular assets architecture. Detailed workflows, helpers, and templates are in the [assets/](assets/) directory:

- **[assets/modes/](assets/modes/)** — INIT, SPRINT, and STATUS mode workflows
- **[assets/helpers/](assets/helpers/)** — Analysis guide, debt tracker, sprint generator, re-entry generator
- **[assets/templates/](assets/templates/)** — Roadmap, sprint, project README, and re-entry prompt templates

See [assets/README.md](assets/README.md) for full directory documentation.

---

## Purpose

Sprint Forge is an **adaptive sprint workflow** skill designed for iterative project execution. Unlike rigid planners that pre-generate all sprints upfront, Sprint Forge:

- **Analyzes first** — deep exploration of the project/issue before committing to a plan
- **Generates sprints one at a time** — each sprint feeds from the previous one's retro, recommendations, and accumulated debt
- **Tracks debt formally** — an accumulated debt table that persists across sprints and never loses items
- **Adapts the roadmap** — the plan evolves based on what execution reveals
- **Persists context** — re-entry prompts allow a new agent (or new session) to recover full context

This skill works for **any** project type, language, or framework.

---

## Critical Rules

> **RULE 1 — SPRINT-BY-SPRINT**
>
> Sprints are generated ONE AT A TIME. Never pre-generate all sprints. Each sprint is informed by the previous sprint's retro, recommendations, and accumulated debt. This ensures the plan adapts to reality.

> **RULE 2 — SUGGESTED PHASES, NOT RIGID**
>
> The roadmap defines suggested phases per sprint. During execution, emergent phases MUST be added when new findings surface. Phases are guidelines, not constraints.

> **RULE 3 — RETRO IS FORMAL INPUT**
>
> The retrospective and recommendations from Sprint N-1 are formal input for Sprint N. Every recommendation must either become a task in the next sprint or have its deferral justified in the Disposition table.

> **RULE 4 — DEBT NEVER DISAPPEARS**
>
> The Accumulated Technical Debt table is inherited sprint to sprint. An item is only closed when explicitly resolved. Items are never deleted — only their status changes.

> **RULE 5 — ADAPTIVE**
>
> The roadmap is a living document. If execution reveals that a planned sprint no longer makes sense, the roadmap is updated. The plan serves execution, not the reverse.

> **RULE 6 — LANGUAGE-AGNOSTIC**
>
> This skill works for any language, framework, or project type. It does not assume Flutter, React, Dart, or any specific technology. The analysis determines the structure.

> **RULE 7 — CONTEXT PERSISTENCE**
>
> After INIT and after each executed sprint, re-entry prompts are updated. These prompts allow any agent in any session to recover full project context and continue seamlessly.

## Mode Detection

| Mode | EN Signals | ES Signals | What It Does |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **INIT** | "analyze", "audit", "start project", "create roadmap" | "analiza", "audita", "inicia proyecto", "crea roadmap" | Analyzes the project, generates findings, creates roadmap, scaffolds vault, generates re-entry prompts |
| **SPRINT** | "generate sprint", "next sprint", "execute sprint" | "genera sprint", "siguiente sprint", "ejecuta sprint" | Generates the next sprint from roadmap + previous sprint + debt, optionally executes it |
| **STATUS** | "project status", "progress", "technical debt" | "estado del proyecto", "progreso", "deuda técnica" | Reports completed sprints, accumulated debt, metrics, next sprint preview |

**Disambiguation**: If the user's intent is unclear, ask:

> "Do you want me to **analyze the project** (INIT), **generate/execute the next sprint** (SPRINT), or **check project status** (STATUS)?"

---

## Quick Start

### INIT Mode

Use when starting a new project workflow:

```
Analyze this project and create a roadmap for the refactoring work.
```

This will: explore the codebase, generate findings, create an adaptive roadmap, scaffold the output directory, and generate re-entry prompts.

**Full workflow:** See [assets/modes/INIT.md](assets/modes/INIT.md)

### SPRINT Mode

Use when ready to work on the next sprint:

```
Generate the next sprint.
```

Or to generate and immediately execute:

```
Generate and execute the next sprint.
```

This will: read the roadmap and previous sprint, build the disposition table, generate phases, and optionally execute task by task.

**Full workflow:** See [assets/modes/SPRINT.md](assets/modes/SPRINT.md)

### STATUS Mode

Use to check project progress:

```
Show me the project status and technical debt.
```

This will: read all sprints, calculate metrics, display progress and accumulated debt.

**Full workflow:** See [assets/modes/STATUS.md](assets/modes/STATUS.md)

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Integration |
|-------|------------|
| `obsidian` | INIT: Use SYNC mode to save findings and roadmap to vault. SPRINT: Use SYNC to update sprint files. STATUS: Use READ to access vault data. Falls back to filesystem if MCP is not available. |
| `code-analyzer` | INIT: Can be used as a preliminary step. The code-analyzer reports feed into Sprint Forge findings, providing structured technical input for the roadmap. |

---

## Limitations

1. **Mode boundary**: Each mode has specific capabilities — INIT cannot execute code, SPRINT cannot create roadmaps, STATUS cannot modify files
2. **One sprint at a time**: By design, you cannot generate multiple sprints in advance
3. **Requires analysis first**: SPRINT mode expects INIT to have been run — it needs a roadmap and findings
4. **Manual execution**: Sprint tasks are executed by the agent, not automated CI/CD
5. **Context window**: For projects with many sprints (>5), use separate sessions per sprint. Re-entry prompts ensure continuity.
6. **No automated validation**: Cannot verify that the roadmap matches codebase reality — relies on thorough analysis during INIT
7. **External blockers**: Cannot resolve dependencies on external teams — logs them as blocked tasks and moves on
8. **Debt resolution**: Debt items require explicit action to close — they don't auto-resolve
