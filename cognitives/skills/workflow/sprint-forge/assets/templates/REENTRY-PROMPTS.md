## Scenario 1 — First Sprint (after INIT)

Use this prompt when INIT has been completed and you need to generate Sprint 1.

```
I'm working on the {project_name} project. The analysis and roadmap have been created.

Read these files in order:
1. {output_dir}/README.md
2. {output_dir}/ROADMAP.md
3. The finding files in {output_dir}/findings/

Then use /sprint-forge to generate Sprint 1. Follow the roadmap's Sprint 1 definition
and the corresponding finding file(s) as input.
```

---

## Scenario 2 — Next Sprint (Sprint N)

Use this prompt when Sprint N-1 is complete and you need to generate Sprint N.

```
I'm continuing work on the {project_name} project. Sprint {N-1} has been completed.

Read these files in order:
1. {output_dir}/README.md
2. {output_dir}/ROADMAP.md
3. {output_dir}/sprints/{last_sprint_file} (pay attention to Retro, Recommendations, and Debt table)
4. The finding file(s) for Sprint {N}: {output_dir}/findings/{next_finding_file}

Then use /sprint-forge to generate Sprint {N}. Ensure all recommendations from Sprint {N-1}
are addressed in the Disposition table.
```

## Scenario 3 — Execute Current Sprint

Use this prompt when a sprint has been generated but not yet executed.

```
I'm working on the {project_name} project. Sprint {N} has been generated and needs execution.

Read these files in order:
1. {output_dir}/README.md
2. {output_dir}/ROADMAP.md
3. {output_dir}/sprints/{current_sprint_file}

Then use /sprint-forge to execute Sprint {N}. Work through each phase and task,
marking progress as you go. Add emergent phases if new work is discovered.
```

---

## Scenario 4 — Check Project Status

Use this prompt to get a progress report.

```
I need a status report on the {project_name} project.

Read these files:
1. {output_dir}/README.md
2. {output_dir}/ROADMAP.md
3. All sprint files in {output_dir}/sprints/

Then use /sprint-forge to generate a status report showing: completed sprints,
accumulated debt, metrics, and what's planned next.
```
