## Project Paths

| Path | Value |
|------|-------|
| Codebase | `{codebase_path}` |
| Working Directory | `{output_dir}` |
| Findings | `{output_dir}/findings/` |
| Sprints | `{output_dir}/sprints/` |

## Execution Rules

These rules govern the entire sprint lifecycle. They are non-negotiable.

1. **Sprint-by-Sprint** — Sprints are generated ONE AT A TIME. Never pre-generate all sprints. Each sprint is informed by the results of the previous one.
2. **Retro Feeds Forward** — The retrospective and recommendations of Sprint N-1 are formal inputs for Sprint N. They cannot be ignored.
3. **Recommendations are Dispositioned** — Every recommendation from the previous sprint must either become a task or have its deferral justified in the Disposition table.
4. **Debt is Inherited** — The Accumulated Technical Debt table passes from sprint to sprint in full. Items are never deleted, only resolved.
5. **Phases are Suggested** — The roadmap defines suggested phases per sprint. During execution, emergent phases MUST be added when new work is discovered.
6. **Emergent Findings Generate Phases** — If execution reveals issues not covered by the plan, new phases are added to the current sprint.
7. **Re-entry Prompts are Updated** — After INIT and after each executed sprint, re-entry prompts are refreshed to reflect current state.
8. **Roadmap Adapts** — If execution reveals that planned sprints need modification, this roadmap is updated. The plan serves execution, not the reverse.
9. **Definition of Done** — Each sprint has explicit completion criteria. A sprint is not done until all DoD items are checked.

## Task States

| Symbol | State | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `[ ]` | Pending | Not started |
| `[~]` | In Progress | Currently being worked on |
| `[x]` | Done | Completed and verified |
| `[!]` | Blocked | Cannot proceed — blocker documented |
| `[-]` | Skipped | Intentionally skipped with justification |
| `[>]` | Carry-over | Not completed — carried over to next sprint |

## Sprint Template

Each sprint in this roadmap follows this structure:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Sprint # | Sequential number |
| Finding Source | Which finding file(s) this sprint addresses |
| Version Target | Target version after this sprint (if applicable) |
| Type | audit / refactor / feature / bugfix / debt |
| Focus | One-line description of the sprint's primary goal |
| Suggested Phases | Initial phases suggested by this roadmap (may expand during execution) |
| Dependencies | Which sprints must complete before this one |

---

## Dependency Map

<!-- Fill during INIT: show which sprints depend on others -->
<!-- Example:
Sprint 1 → Sprint 2 → Sprint 3
                    ↘ Sprint 4 → Sprint 5
-->

```

## Sprint Summary

<!-- Fill during INIT: one row per planned sprint -->

| Sprint | Finding Source | Version | Type | Focus | Dependencies | Status |
|--------|--------------|---------|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | `{finding_file}` | {version} | {type} | {focus} | — | pending |

---

## Detailed Sprint Definitions

<!-- Fill during INIT: expand each sprint with suggested phases -->

### Sprint 1 — {title}

- **Source**: `findings/{finding_file}`
- **Version Target**: {version}
- **Type**: {type}
- **Focus**: {focus}
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Suggested Phases**:
  1. {phase_1_name} — {phase_1_description}
  2. {phase_2_name} — {phase_2_description}

<!-- Add more sprints as needed. The number of sprints is determined by the analysis. -->
