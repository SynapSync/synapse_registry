## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **obsidian** skill (integrations, v3.8.0): RULE 0 "SKILL BEFORE MCP" guardrail — agents must follow SKILL.md workflow before calling any `mcp__obsidian__*` tools directly. Cross-Skill Invocation section with 3-priority invocation guide (Skill tool, natural language trigger, direct SKILL.md read). Expanded `auto_invoke` from 8 to 31 patterns covering EN/ES, SYNC/READ, and vault variants.

### Changed
- **code-analyzer** skill (analytics, v2.5.0): Post-Production Delivery updated with explicit obsidian skill invocation block and MCP guardrail.
- **universal-planner** skill (planning, v3.5.0): EXECUTE mode Post-Production Delivery updated with obsidian invocation block. Integration table updated with explicit invocation instructions and MCP guardrail.
- **sprint-forge** skill (workflow, v1.6.0): Integration table updated with explicit obsidian skill invocation instructions and MCP guardrail.
- **project-brain** skill (workflow, v2.6.0): Integration table updated with explicit obsidian skill invocation instructions and MCP guardrail.
- **CLAUDE.md**: Post-Production Delivery convention template updated with obsidian invocation block (`Skill("obsidian")`, natural language fallback, subagent fallback, MCP guardrail).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Lazy Asset Loading convention** — modular skills (2+ modes) must include `## Asset Loading (Mode-Gated)` section with explicit "Do NOT Read" column to prevent agents from reading unnecessary assets.
- **Quick Start convention** — skills use imperative "Assets to read now:" instead of passive references.
- **universal-planner** skill (planning, v3.4.0): Asset Loading (Mode-Gated) section, Quick Start section, lightweight `output-resolve.md` helper (fast path for `output_dir` resolution). Trimmed `config-resolver.md`.
- **obsidian** skill (integrations, v3.7.0): Quick Start section with mode-specific asset references.
- **project-brain** skill (workflow, v2.5.0): Lightweight `brain-resolve.md` helper for LOAD mode (~170 tokens vs ~1,570). LOAD no longer reads `brain-config.md`.

### Changed
- **obsidian** skill (integrations, v3.6.0): Mode-gated lazy asset loading — agents only read assets for the active mode (SYNC or READ). Extracted Tool Dependencies to `assets/helpers/tool-reference.md`.
- **project-brain** skill (workflow, v2.4.0): Mode-gated lazy asset loading.
- **sprint-forge** skill (workflow, v1.5.0): Asset Loading (Mode-Gated) table added.
- **code-analyzer** skill (analytics, v2.4.0): Removed changelog from frontmatter, removed Version History section.
- Removed `changelog:` key from all SKILL.md frontmatters (canonical source: `manifest.json`).
- Removed `## Version History` sections from all SKILL.md bodies.

### Fixed
- `output_dir` never silently falls back to staging — always asks the user first.
- **project-brain**: Simplified `brain_dir` default path and config prompt.

---

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Branded AGENTS.md block** — `<!-- synapsync-skills:start/end -->` delimiters with shared `## Configuration` table. Any skill can add its config keys to the table. Single source of truth for skill configuration across sessions.
- **Configuration Resolution convention** — skills persist config keys (output paths, vault destinations) in AGENTS.md branded block. 6-case persistence rules for block creation/update.

### Changed
- **project-brain** skill (workflow, v2.3.0): Branded AGENTS.md block format with shared Configuration table (replaces hidden `<!-- synapsync:config -->` HTML comment). Updated `brain-config.md` helper with 6-case persistence rules.
- **obsidian** skill (integrations, v3.5.0): Branded AGENTS.md block support. New `vault_destination` config key — vault path remembered across sessions, no re-prompting.
- **sprint-forge** skill (workflow, v1.4.0): Branded AGENTS.md block support. New `output_dir` config key — supplements auto-discovery and re-entry prompts.
- **universal-planner** skill (planning, v3.3.0): Branded AGENTS.md block support. New `output_dir` config key — supplements deterministic staging fallback.
- **code-analyzer** skill (analytics, v2.3.0): Branded AGENTS.md block support. New `output_dir` config key — supplements deterministic staging fallback.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **project-brain** skill (workflow, v2.0.0): Session memory for AI agents with LOAD and SAVE modes. SAVE has INIT (create new) and UPDATE (incremental merge) sub-modes. Auto-discovery of brain documents. Standard brain document format with Project Identity, Active State, Session Log (newest-first), Accumulated Context (append-only), Next Steps, and Key Files. Backward-compatible parsing: v2.0, v1.0, and free-form. Modular assets: 2 modes, 1 helper, 1 template.
- **project-brain** skill (workflow, v2.1.0): Pre-write backup (`.bak`), session IDs for idempotent saves, semantic duplicate detection, session retrospective section, language separation (conversation in user's language, brain document always in English).

### Changed
- **obsidian** skill (integrations): Corrected MCP tool prefixes, params, and version regex.

### Fixed
- **sprint-forge** skill (workflow): Corrected `{output_dir}` discovery docs in INIT Step 2.

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **sprint-forge** skill (workflow, v1.1.0): Adaptive sprint workflow with 3 modes (INIT, SPRINT, STATUS). Deep analysis, evolving roadmap, one-at-a-time sprint generation, formal debt tracking with inheritance, re-entry prompts for context persistence. Carry-over task state `[>]`, execution metadata, disposition actions, findings consolidation, evidence fields, "New Technical Debt Detected" retro subsection. Language-agnostic. Modular assets: 3 modes, 4 helpers, 4 templates.
- **Deterministic staging pattern** — `.agents/staging/{skill-name}/{project-name}/` convention for all output-producing skills.
- Post-production delivery step convention for output-producing skills.

### Changed
- **sprint-forge** skill (workflow, v1.3.0): Interactive path resolution replacing rigid staging pattern. Removed post-production delivery from INIT/SPRINT modes. Added Step 0 to SPRINT/STATUS for locating `{output_dir}`.
- **universal-planner** skill (planning, v3.2.0): Migrated to staging pattern, renamed `{output_base}` to `{output_dir}`, added post-production delivery to EXECUTE mode.
- **code-analyzer** skill (analytics, v2.2.0): Migrated to staging pattern, renamed `{output_base}` to `{output_dir}`, added post-production delivery.
- **obsidian** skill (integrations, v3.4.0): Migrated to staging convention, batch-move-from-staging workflow in SYNC mode.

- **obsidian** skill (integrations, v3.3.0): Filesystem fallback for SYNC mode — MCP changed from hard dependency to optional. Added Step 0 access mode detection, YAML serialization guidance for filesystem writes.

### Fixed
- **universal-planner** skill (planning, v3.1.0): Audit remediation — 25 findings resolved. Unified task granularity (Sprint/Phase/Task/Subtask), PROGRESS.md template, before/after code fields, BUG_FIX fast path, sprint failed status, plan freshness check.
- **obsidian** skill (integrations): Prevented vault path defaulting to `agents/` folder.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

Optimized cross-ref-validator with `update_frontmatter`, priority-ranking with `get_notes_info` metadata fast path. Added archive/delete and move/reorganize workflows.
- **universal-planner** skill (planning, v3.0.0): Consolidated universal-planner + universal-planner-executor into unified skill with PLAN and EXECUTE modes. PLAN mode produces documentation only; EXECUTE mode implements sprints with dual roles (Senior Developer + Scrum Master).

### Fixed
- **obsidian** skill (integrations, v3.1.0): Audit remediation — 20 findings resolved across 3 rounds. Added i18n documentation, tool parameter contracts, reconciled type taxonomy to 14 types, ambiguous intent disambiguation, batch size limits, negative weights for superseded/archived.
