## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Convention**: Replace `{project-name}` with `{scope}` in Configuration Resolution default suggestion across all skills and docs. `{scope}` represents the work topic (e.g., `oauth-implementation`, `ui-redesign`), not the repo name — avoids redundant paths like `project/.agents/skill/project/`.
- **growth-ceo** skill (planning, v2.1.0): Configuration Resolution uses `{scope}`. Fix Step 3 Persist inconsistency — replace `{project-name}` with `{analysis-name}` to match existing naming convention.
- **code-analyzer** skill (analytics, v2.7.0): Configuration Resolution uses `{scope}`.
- **skill-creator** skill (general, v3.4.0): Configuration Resolution uses `{scope}`.
- **project-brain** skill (workflow, v2.9.0): Configuration Resolution, brain-config, and brain-resolve defaults use `{scope}`.

### Removed
- **sprint-forge** skill (workflow, v1.10.0): Removed from registry — migrated to a workflow cognitive type. Will be re-added as a workflow in a future release.
- **universal-planner** skill (planning, v3.6.0): Removed from registry.
- **growth-architect** skill (planning, v2.6.0): Removed from registry.

### Changed
- **growth-ceo** skill (planning, v2.0.0): BREAKING — Complete rewrite. Vision-first thinking replaces constraint-first thinking. Never limits strategy to current team size or budget. Added 7 Powers framework (Hamilton Helmer), Flywheel design, Musk's Algorithm (5-step first principles), Bezos Type 1/Type 2 decisions, Christensen's Disruption Radar, Grove's Strategic Inflection Points, Horowitz Wartime/Peacetime CEO, Hoffman Blitzscaling conditions, Thiel Monopoly Theory, Musk's Idiot Index. New output: Contrarian Truth → Strategic Diagnosis → Initiatives (with Resource Acquisition Plan) → Flywheel Map → Positioning & GTM → First Moves → What NOT to Build → 10X Question. Deep thinking expanded to 15 candidates with 5-dimensional scoring.
- **sprint-forge** skill (workflow, v1.10.0): Add checkpoint-per-phase persistence rule to EXECUTE workflow. Sprint file is now written to disk after each phase completes, ensuring progress survives agent crashes or session timeouts without fragmenting task-to-task execution flow.

### Added
- **sprint-forge** skill (workflow, v1.9.0): YAML frontmatter properties on all templates (SPRINT, ROADMAP, PROJECT-README, REENTRY-PROMPTS) and finding file format. New `agents` field tracks AI model names (e.g., claude-opus-4-6, gpt-4o, codex) that created/modified documents. INIT and SPRINT modes updated with frontmatter generation and close-time update instructions.
- **obsidian** skill (integrations, v4.1.0): New `agents` field in universal frontmatter schema — tracks AI model names that created or modified documents. Updated frontmatter-generator with agents merge rule (append, never remove). Updated obsidian-md-standard extended fields table.

### Added
- **growth-ceo** skill (planning, v1.3.0): CEO-level strategic initiative engine. Output structure: Focal Question -> Constraint-Aware Diagnosis -> Ranked Initiatives (Problem/Vision/Execution/Impact/Risks/Reference) -> Positioning & First Moves ("Don't say X, say Y" + 3 this-week actions) -> What NOT to Do. Constraints-first thinking filters ideas through team/runway/budget reality. Persists approved initiatives to `{output_dir}/initiatives/`. Configuration Resolution via AGENTS.md branded block. Post-Production Delivery with Obsidian sync option.
- **growth-architect** skill (planning, v2.6.0): AI Co-Founder & Growth Architect for strategic clarity, product vision, MVP design, and architecture decisions (ADRs). Modular assets (1 mode, 1 helper, 2 templates). Strategic-only responsibility — execution delegated to sprint-forge. Uses `{output_dir}` convention. Includes Configuration Resolution, Asset Loading, Post-Production Delivery.
- **obsidian** skill (integrations, v3.8.0): RULE 0 "SKILL BEFORE MCP" guardrail — agents must follow SKILL.md workflow before calling any `mcp__obsidian__*` tools directly. Cross-Skill Invocation section with 3-priority invocation guide (Skill tool, natural language trigger, direct SKILL.md read). Expanded `auto_invoke` from 8 to 31 patterns covering EN/ES, SYNC/READ, and vault variants.

### Changed
- **universal-planner** skill (planning, v3.6.0): Remove MCP guardrail from obsidian integration table and EXECUTE mode Post-Production Delivery — obsidian skill is now filesystem-only.
- **code-analyzer** skill (analytics, v2.6.0): Remove NEVER `mcp__obsidian__*` line from Post-Production Delivery — obsidian skill is now filesystem-only.
- **project-brain** skill (workflow, v2.8.0): Remove MCP guardrail from obsidian integration table. Update LOAD.md to use filesystem `Read` for Obsidian vault paths (drop ToolSearch + `mcp__obsidian__read_note`). Rename "Read brain from Obsidian MCP" to "Read brain from Obsidian vault" in Capabilities Matrix.
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated obsidian skill description (filesystem-based). Removed MCP guardrail from Post-Production Delivery template. Simplified obsidian validation rule.
- **README.md**: Updated Obsidian Integration section — Two Modes table, architecture diagram, and prerequisites all updated to reflect filesystem-only approach (no MCP).
- **obsidian** skill (integrations, v4.0.0): Breaking — remove MCP dependency entirely. Filesystem-only operation using Read/Write/Edit/Glob/Grep/Bash. Rewrite SYNC.md and READ.md (no dual MCP/fallback branches). Delete tool-reference.md. Remove ToolSearch from allowed-tools. Simplify rules (remove RULE 0 SKILL BEFORE MCP and RULE 1 DETECT ACCESS MODE).
- **obsidian** skill (integrations, v3.9.0): Removed sprint-forge from Integration table (sprint-forge decoupled). Removed AGENTS.md branded block dependency for `vault_destination` — resolved at runtime via SYNC mode Step 3 (always asks user). Removed sprint-forge from SYNC.md staging-aware producer list.
- **sprint-forge** skill (workflow, v1.8.0): Removed obsidian integration — syncing to vault is now a separate, explicit user step. Eliminates the 3-layer chain (sprint-forge → obsidian skill → MCP) that caused inconsistent results.
- **sprint-forge** skill (workflow, v1.7.0): Replaced AGENTS.md branded block dependency for `output_dir` with re-entry prompt + README as sources of truth. INIT now asks user once and stores path in both files. SPRINT Step 0 extracts `output_dir` from re-entry prompt paths as primary source. Simplified Configuration Resolution to 3 clear rules.
- **project-brain** skill (workflow, v2.7.0): Strengthened mandatory user prompt for `brain_dir` resolution — agents can no longer silently choose the default path. New RULE 7 (NO SILENT DEFAULTS). `brain-config.md` Step 2 marked MANDATORY. `SAVE.md` Step 0 includes enforcement note.
- **code-analyzer** skill (analytics, v2.5.0): Post-Production Delivery updated with explicit obsidian skill invocation block and MCP guardrail.
- **universal-planner** skill (planning, v3.5.0): EXECUTE mode Post-Production Delivery updated with obsidian invocation block. Integration table updated with explicit invocation instructions and MCP guardrail.
- **sprint-forge** skill (workflow, v1.6.0): Integration table updated with explicit obsidian skill invocation instructions and MCP guardrail.
- **project-brain** skill (workflow, v2.6.0): Integration table updated with explicit obsidian skill invocation instructions and MCP guardrail.
- **CLAUDE.md**: Post-Production Delivery convention template updated with obsidian invocation block (`Skill("obsidian")`, natural language fallback, subagent fallback, MCP guardrail).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Lazy Asset Loading convention** — modular skills (2+ modes) must include `## Asset Loading (Mode-Gated)` section with explicit "Do NOT Read" column to prevent agents from reading unnecessary assets.
- **Quick Start convention** — skills use imperative "Assets to read now:" instead of passive references.
- **universal-planner** skill (planning, v3.4.0): Asset Loading (Mode-Gated) section, Quick Start section, lightweight `output-resolve.md` helper (fast path for `output_dir` resolution). Trimmed `config-resolver.md`.
